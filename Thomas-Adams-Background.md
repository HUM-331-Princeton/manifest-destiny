title: Who Was Thomas Adams?

A few fateful months ago I chose the enigmatically titled
["Journal"](https://dpul.princeton.edu/pudl0017/catalog/qr46r491g) from Firestone Library's Western Americana Collection,
and my journey with Thomas Adams began. Now, as Sophie and I wrap up our final
project for HUM 331, I'm here to contextualize _who_ Thomas Adams is so that
you've got some background information.

Thomas Adams was a civil engineer, and at just 23 he was a part of the [Stevens Pacific Railroad Survey](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/botany/about/historical-expeditions/stevens-pacific-railroad-survey). Running for two years, from 1853-1855, the Survey was one of 6 expeditions Congress funded that same year to try to find the best railroad route from the Pacific Ocean to the Mississippi River. The Stevens Survey went
(North by) Northwest, through North Dakota, Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. The particular journal we're using for the project actually starts off in Washington, DC, with the real travel beginning to be documented in Minnesota.

On the trip, Adams was designated as a meteorologist and topographer, and the
language of his journal reflects this. He tends to write fairly short and informative entries, occasionally interjecting his frustration with the monotony of the food or the annoyances of travel; but he keeps it pretty impersonal. There are many sketches in his journals (but they bear an uncanny resemblance to [some of those done by Gustavus Sohon](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112106670174&view=1up&seq=5), who was also part of the Survey). He also documented the languages of the Indigenous peoples he encountered, with a small translation guide included in the back of the journal.  

Later in life, Adams was involved in brokering treaties between Indigenous groups, specifically the Bitterroot Salish and the US Government.

With all this in mind, I hope you enjoy learning about Thomas Adams and Nellie Martin Wade through this project!
