We wanted to create a space to present these journals in several ways so that they could be made accessible to anyone who wants to learn more about primary source
documents of the period. By looking at the journals with a comparative lens, we have been able to gain further knowledge about the journals and their authors and present it in new and interesting ways. We've used several types of digital tools, as well as both audio and visual elements, to try and make the information as dynamic and accessible as possible. We hope that you have found it interesting and learned something new!

Best,
<br>Hope and Sophie
