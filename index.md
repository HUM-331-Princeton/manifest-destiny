This project explores the 1853-54 journal of Thomas Adams, a civil engineer, alongside the 1906 journal of Nellie Martin Wade, a homemaker and educator. In the theme of Manifest Destiny, each of these authors journeyed west and captured their observations in writing, which is now housed in the [Western Americana Collection](https://library.princeton.edu/special-collections/divisions/princeton-collections-american-west) at Firestone Library. Set across the United States in the territories west of the Mississippi River and the mountains of Alaska, these journals reveal the mindset and motivations of their authors. We invite you to explore!
